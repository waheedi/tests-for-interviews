##	Merging overlapping intervals -> intervals_test.rb
### the question: You need to write a function that reads a list of intervals from STDIN , merges the intervals that are overlapping and write the resulting list to STDOUT, If your function reads a list of intervals that contain (2,4) and (3,5), because those two intervals have an overlap they should be merged into a single interval (2,5)
Sample Input
[0,1][2,4][6,7][3,5]
Sample Output
[0,1][2,5][6,7]
